    "The goal of this tutorial is to introduce the basic functionality of AI Fairness 360 for detecting and mitigating bias. As before, we will work with the German Credit dataset. There are many metrics one can use to detect the presence of bias. Likewise, there are many different bias mitigation algorithms one can employ. AI Fairness 360 provides some of them most common metrics and algorithms.\n",

    "### Bias mitigation techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "We learnt about the different bias mitigation techniques in class called _pre-processing_, _in-processing_, and _post-processing_.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use AI Fairness 360 (`aif360`) to detect and mitigate bias. We will look for bias in the creation of a machine learning model that predicts whether an applicant should be given credit based on various features from a typical credit application. The protected attribute will be \"Age\", with \"1\" (older than or equal to 25) and \"0\" (younger than 25) being the values for the _privileged_ and _unprivileged_ groups, respectively.\n",

    "In this notebook, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install and import packages and modules\n",
    "2. Load dataset, split between train and test, and compute fairness metrics on original training dataset\n",
    "3. Mitigate bias using a pre-processing algorithm (reweighing)\n",
    "4. Mitigate bias using an in-processing algorithm (adversarial debiasing)\n",
    "5. Mitigate bias using a post-processing algorithm (equalized odds post processing)"

    "> Adversarial debiasing is an in-processing technique that learns a classifier to maximize prediction accuracy and simultaneously reduce an adversary’s ability to determine the protected attribute from the predictions. This approach leads to a fair classifier as the predictions cannot carry any group discrimination information that the adversary can exploit.\n",
    "\n",
    "For intuition, you can think of adversarial debiasing as a model with two supervised learning tasks. The first task is to predict an outcome using the training data input. The second task, i.e. the adversary, is to predict a protected feature using these predictions and non-protected features in the training data input. The aim is to maximize the model's ability to carry out the first task (i.e. predict outcomes) while minimizing its ability to carry out the second task (i.e. predict protected features).\n",
